# Cyanometer

**Under construction.**

Currently unlicensed, will provide one eventually.

Setup info
- create applicationSettings.test.config in project root folder

Remarks
- Currently contains [raspberry-sharp-io](https://github.com/raspberry-sharp/raspberry-sharp-io), [raspberry-sharp-system](https://github.com/raspberry-sharp/raspberry-sharp-system) and [WittyPiNet](https://github.com/MihaMarkic/WittyPiNet) sources because raspberry-sharp-system (core assembly) doesn't handle Raspberry PI 3 B correctly (Processor.Unknown) and I duct-type fixed it.  
Once that is fixed, it will switch to NuGet packages.
